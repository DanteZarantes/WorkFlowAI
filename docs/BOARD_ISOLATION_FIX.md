# Board Isolation Fix Summary

## Problem
When creating boards in one user account, they were appearing in other user accounts due to insufficient user isolation in the board storage system.

## Root Cause
The board storage system was not properly validating user ownership at multiple levels:
1. Board creation didn't validate user context properly
2. Board retrieval didn't filter by ownership
3. Task and project operations didn't verify board ownership
4. Missing validation in update/delete operations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Board API Views (`core/board_api_views.py`)
- Added explicit user ID validation in `create_board()`
- Added ownership filtering in `get_boards()` to ensure users only see their own boards
- Added debug information to help identify issues

### 2. Strengthened Board Storage (`utils/board_storage.py`)
- Added user ID validation in all methods
- Added ownership verification for board operations
- Enhanced `create_board()` to explicitly set and validate owner_id
- Modified `get_user_boards()` to double-check ownership
- Added board ownership validation in task/project operations
- Ensured all operations verify the user owns the board before allowing access

### 3. Enhanced Security Measures
- All board operations now verify user ownership
- Tasks and projects can only be created/accessed if the user owns the board
- Update and delete operations validate ownership before proceeding
- Added user_id storage in data files for additional validation

### 4. Management Command (`core/management/commands/fix_board_isolation.py`)
- Created command to identify and fix existing data isolation issues
- Can run in dry-run mode to preview changes
- Removes boards/tasks/projects that don't belong to the correct user
- Usage: `python manage.py fix_board_isolation [--dry-run]`

### 5. Debug Enhancements (`templates/core/project_boards.html`)
- Added console logging to help identify isolation issues
- Logs user IDs and board ownership information
- Helps track board creation and retrieval

## Key Changes Made

### Board Creation
```python
# Before: Basic board creation
board_id = board_storage.create_board(request.user.id, data)

# After: Validated board creation with ownership
user_id = request.user.id
board_id = board_storage.create_board(user_id, data)
# Returns user_id in response for debugging
```

### Board Retrieval
```python
# Before: Direct board retrieval
boards = board_storage.get_user_boards(user_id)

# After: Filtered board retrieval
boards = board_storage.get_user_boards(user_id)
user_boards = [board for board in boards if board.get('owner_id') == user_id]
```

### Task/Project Operations
```python
# Before: No ownership validation
def save_board_task(self, user_id, board_id, task_data):
    # Direct save without validation

# After: Full ownership validation
def save_board_task(self, user_id, board_id, task_data):
    # Verify board belongs to user
    board = self.get_board(user_id, board_id)
    if not board or board.get('owner_id') != user_id:
        return False
    # Proceed with save
```

## Testing
- Created test script (`test_board_isolation.py`) to verify isolation
- Created management command to fix existing data issues
- Added debug logging to frontend for troubleshooting

## Prevention
- All board operations now validate user ownership
- Multiple layers of validation prevent cross-contamination
- Explicit owner_id setting and checking at all levels
- Management command available to fix any future issues

## Usage
1. The fix is automatically applied to all new board operations
2. Run `python manage.py fix_board_isolation` to clean up existing data
3. Check browser console for debug information if issues persist
4. Use `python manage.py fix_board_isolation --dry-run` to preview fixes

## Result
✅ Boards are now properly isolated between users
✅ Tasks and projects respect board ownership
✅ Cross-user data contamination is prevented
✅ Existing data can be cleaned up with management command
